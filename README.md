# UBS
Implement a simple test automation project:
•	Decide what features can be automated on www.ubs.com +
Notes: 
We have "business card" type of web-site in the task. The main goals of this kind of site are:
1. To provide some information about a company (possibility to use different domiciles to read 
an info about company's service for some spetial regions)
2. To use "Contact us" form for Potential Customers.
3. To see locations of UBS's offices 

•	Write 3-5 scenarios in feature files preferably using Specflow (other BDD tools such as Cucumber are also acceptable) +
•	Implement above in steps preferably using C# (Java or other alternatives are also acceptable) +
•	Make project configurable, so it is possible to run test suite for particular:
                                                 - language +
						                                      Notes: Localization check added
                                                 - instance +
                                                 - user 
						                                      Notes: I don't see the possibility to use different users/user roles.
						                                      If this is about different test data for users to fill different forms,
						                                      so it was implemented.
